Okay so basically,
it all started when I got the Samsung Galaxy J7 and its warranty ended. I didn't know what rooting was at that time,
and when my dad told me he'd root my phone and install Android 10 (since the max it can run is 9) and so it started.
I then got the M31 (ok phone, but way too cut off) and I decided to root it myself, because why not? 
*Yeah it failed*.
I tried again, and **it was successful, nice.**
Oh and I like Android develpoment now.
For now only GSIs but I wanna try my hand at a Custom ROM.
Yeah that's basically it.
***Currenly maintaining m31nsxx (GSI)***
EDIT: I tried my hand at a custom ROM. **I suck**.
