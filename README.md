- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitalitk!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in Python and customizing Android phones!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to port a Custom ROM and making Treble overlays.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on vendor_hardware_overlays since my M31 didn't have an overlay, so there were no features that were present in One UI.
- 📫 How to reach me: Using my Telegram, of course: "@vitalitkk"
